"""The GlossX core agent: route -> plan -> execute -> verify -> reflect.

:func:`run_agent` drives one goal to a grounded answer:

1. **Context**: recall the project's memory notes relevant to the goal.
2. **Route**: the decider picks a workflow (``workflow.*`` capabilities, top-k
   by card BM25) or ``generic``; the loop is the requested one, else the
   workflow's ``loop.use``, else ``plan-execute-verify``.
3. **Workflow** (if routed): the engine runs the manifest's steps.
4. **Loop**: plan/execute (generic) then synthesize -> verify -> reflect.
5. **Memory**: supported claims are appended to the project's memory.

Every claim in the answer cites evidence spans (``[S:<paper_id>#<chunk>]``)
and is graded by the verifier. Step failures become observations; only an
unrecoverable synthesis failure in the first round fails the run. Every
provider call is metered against the run's budget.
